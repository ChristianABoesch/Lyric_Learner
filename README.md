# Lyric_Learner
A fun app to learn and practice lyrics.

I am building this web application to help my friends memorize lyrics. When we go to perform music together, I can sit at the piano and play the songs. Usually, I remember how the chords in the verses and chorus go. It's actually not that hard to remember the chords for a song if you've heard it quite a few times, but even though I can remember the music I can't always remember the lyrics. My friends who want to come and sing along with me also have the same problem. Sometimes people think that they know the words to a song because they have before, but they may not have sung the song in many months or even years. It would be great if people had a website where they could learn or refresh their memory for lyrics. The website could be rather simple. You could just ask the user to type in the words to a given song from the set list. The user could start typing each word from the lyrics until they got a word incorrectly. Then, the system could ask them to start over from the beginning of the song or from the previous line. As soon as the person can type out the entire song with only one or two mistakes, they should be a lot more confident that they're ready to sing their lyrics from memory, and focus on their fellow performers and the audience.
